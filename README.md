# writing_seminar


Our goal is to write a paper in 6 weeks. 

Complete with the creation of a data archive and, if relevant, a pre-registration.
The assumption is that you do not need to do original data collection in this time frame but you do need to do analysis and writing.

Our steps will be:

1. Introduction
  1. Task: Describe the design informally in MIDA terms
  2. Task: Identify relevant literature and a model article
2. Design
  1. Task: Formally "declare" the design, present the declaration
  2. Task: Situate the contribution, present the contribution
  3. Task: Read one piece from relevant literature of at least 2 classmates 
3. Writing from inside out
  1. Task: *Before class*: Share abstract, introduction, and paper outline, identifying any additional analyses
  2. Task: *In class*: Present *Main Results*, table or figure
4. Draft 1 shared and discussed
  1. Task: *Before class*: Share draft 1
  2. Task: Read draft of at least 2 classmates 
5. Final class presentations
  1. Task: Incorporate comments, complete a draft
