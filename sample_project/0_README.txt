You can open this project in Rstudio by double clicking on sample_project.Rproj

1. analysis is done in 1_analysis.qmd this saves all objects used for presentations and papers

2. If you then run 
  knitr::purl("1_analysis.qmd",  "2_replication_code.R")
  knitr::spin("2_replication_code.R")  
 it will generate and run a simple R replication file, extracting code from 1_analysis.qmd

3. 3_presentation.qmd reates a presentation using objects generated by 1_analysis.qmd

4. 4_simple_paper_template.qmd gives a very simple paper template that is good for most purposes

5. 5_fancy_paper_template.qmd uses a more complex structure with fancier options

6. 6_overleaf_prep puts files (figures and tables) in the exports folder, which can be copied to overleaf; a tex file is saved on compile which can be used as starter code for importing figures and tables with cross references.
