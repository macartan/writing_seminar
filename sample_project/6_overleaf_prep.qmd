This file creates a simple .tex file and a folder with tables and figures that can be uploaded or synced with overleaf. Figures and Tables (tex) are saved to "exports" which can be copied directly to overleaf (or synched). The .tex file is also saved and so you can quickly extract the code for importing figures and tables and cross referencing them.

```{r base_setup}
#| include: false
# Thanks to Christopher Kenny for this template and to Daniel Kuhlen for further development https://github.com/danielkuhlen/academicwriting
# Commands that are useful for extracting code and replicating results:
# knitr::purl("paper_template.qmd")
# knitr::spin("paper_template.R")

# A tool to help with citations
# devtools::install_github("crsh/citr")

# packages ---
if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,
  knitr,
  DeclareDesign,
  modelsummary,
  rio, # import export files
  extrafont, # fonts for plots
  texreg
  )


# fonts --- 
extrafont::loadfonts(quiet = TRUE)

load("saved/analysis.Rdata")
theme_set(theme_bw())

# a helper to avoid double captions when using texreg
tex_clean <- function(models, ...) {
  out <- texreg::texreg(models, ..., return.string = TRUE)
  # Remove \caption{} and \label{} lines
  out <- gsub("\\\\caption\\{.*?\\}", "", out)
  out <- gsub("\\\\label\\{.*?\\}", "", out)
  out <- gsub("\\\\begin\\{center\\}", "", out)
  out <- gsub("\\\\end\\{center\\}", "", out)
  return(out)
}

```


## A sample figure

Here is a figure. See @fig-1.

```{r}
#| include: false
figure_1 

ggsave("exports/fig-1.png", width = 8, height = 6)
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "A sample figure: Information about this figure"
#| out-width: "95%"
#| 
include_graphics("exports/fig-1.png")
```


## A table

See Table \ref{tbl-simple}. 


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: 'asis'
#| 

texreg(models, include.ci = FALSE, return.string = TRUE,
       caption = "What it is about",
       label = "tbl-simple") |>
  write_lines("exports/table-1.txt")


```


\input{"exports/table-1.txt"}
